/**
 * This module defines Redux logic for handling password reset confirmation using @reduxjs/toolkit, axios, and react-hot-toast.
 * 
 * The `ForgetPasswordConfirm` asynchronous thunk sends a POST request to the "auth/users/reset_password_confirm/" 
 * endpoint with the user's reset data. If successful, the backend should confirm the user's password reset.
 * 
 * `ForgetPasswordConfirmSlice` manages the Redux state for this password reset confirmation process. It initializes
 * with default data, status, and error states, and updates these states based on the async thunk's lifecycle:
 * - Displays a loading toast when the password reset confirmation is in process.
 * - Shows a success toast upon successful password change.
 * - Shows an error toast if the password reset fails due to incorrect reset code or other issues.
 * 
 * The state and actions in this slice facilitate integration of the password reset confirmation process into a React application,
 * enhancing user feedback and interactivity during the password reset flow.
