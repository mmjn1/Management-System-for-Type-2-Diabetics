/**
 * Redux slice and asynchronous thunk for handling password reset confirmation functionality.
 * 
 * The `ForgetPasswordConfirm` is an asynchronous thunk that sends a POST request to the
 * "auth/users/reset_password_confirm/" endpoint with user data for confirming a password reset.
 * It uses Axios for making HTTP requests.
 * 
 * `ForgetPasswordConfirmSlice` is a Redux slice containing state related to the password reset confirmation process.
 * It defines an initial state, reducer actions, and handles the different states (loading, succeeded, failed)
 * of the asynchronous request in extraReducers.
 * 
 * Toast notifications from 'react-hot-toast' are utilized to provide user feedback during the request lifecycle:
 * - Displays a loading toast when the request is pending.
 * - Displays a success toast when the request is fulfilled and the password is successfully changed.
 * - Displays an error toast when the request is rejected due to failed password reset confirmation.
