/**
 * This redux slice and asynchronous thunk for handling forgotten password functionality.
 * 
 * The `ForgetPasswordfunction` is an asynchronous thunk that sends a POST request to the
 * "auth/users/reset_password/" endpoint with user data for resetting a forgotten password.
 * It utilizes Axios for HTTP requests.
 * 
 * `ForgetPasswordSlice` is a Redux slice that contains the state related to the forgotten password process.
 * It includes the initial state, reducer actions, and handles different states (loading, succeeded, failed)
 * of the asynchronous request through extraReducers.
 * 
 * Toast notifications from 'react-hot-toast' are used to provide feedback during the request lifecycle:
 * - Displays a loading toast when the request is pending.
 * - Displays a success toast when the request is fulfilled.
 * - Displays an error toast when the request is rejected.
